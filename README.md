# Image Style Transfer

This project demonstrates the implementation of neural style transfer, which applies the artistic style of one image to another image using deep learning techniques.

## Overview
Neural style transfer is an application of deep learning where the style of a reference image (e.g., a painting) is applied to a target image (e.g., a photograph), producing an image that appears to be painted in the style of the reference image.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/therealmazin/Image_Style_Transfer>
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook IMGSTYLTRANSFER.ipynb
    ```

## Example Results
